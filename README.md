### About Me

I’m a deep learning engineer driven by a passion for real-world impact. I build high-performance vision systems and intelligent tools for a range of industries — especially where reliability and explainability matter.

My work focuses on turning raw data into clear insights, using tools like **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **TensorRT**, and deploying models with **Docker** in challenging, real-time environments.
